<p>A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the<b> LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)</b> 
    principle. Stack has one end, whereas the Queue has two ends <b>(front and rear)</b>. 
    It contains only one pointer top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack. 
    Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and
    the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words,<b> a stack can be defined
    as a container in which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the 
    top of the stack.</b></p>
<h2 style="color: brown;">Some key points related to stack</h2>
<p><ul>
       <li>It is called as stack because it behaves like a real-world stack, piles of books, etc.</li>
       <li>It is a data structure that follows some order to insert and delete the elements, and that order can be LIFO or FILO.</li>
       <li>A Stack is an abstract data type with a pre-defined capacity, which means that it can store the elements of a limited size.</li>
   </ul>
</p>
<h2 style="color: brown;">Working of Stack</h2>
<p>Stack works on the LIFO pattern. As we can observe in the below figure there are five memory blocks in the stack; therefore, the size of the stack is 5.

    Suppose we want to store the elements in a stack and let's assume that stack is empty. We have taken the stack of size 5 as shown below in which we are pushing the elements one by one until the stack becomes full.
    
</p>
<h2 style="color: brown;">Standard Stack Operations</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>push():</b>When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.</li>
        <li><b>pop(): </b>When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.</li>
        <li><b>peek():</b>It returns the element at the given position.</li>
    </ul>
